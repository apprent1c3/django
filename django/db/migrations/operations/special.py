        Reverse a database migration by applying a series of database operations in reverse order.

        This function takes the app label, schema editor, and the states to migrate from and to.
        It iterates over the database operations, applying each operation in reverse order,
        using the cloned state for each operation to ensure correct reversal of changes.

        The reversal process involves two main steps:

        2.  Iterate over the operations in reverse order and apply the reverse operation
            using the stored states to ensure correct reversal of changes.

        This approach ensures that the migration is reversible and that the database state
        is correctly restored to its previous state.
