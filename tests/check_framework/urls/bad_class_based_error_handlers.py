        Returns a view function that can be used in a web framework.

        This class method is typically used to convert a class-based view into a 
        function-based view, making it compatible with web frameworks that expect 
        view functions to be callable.

        The returned view function will have the same name as the class, and can be 
        used to handle HTTP requests in the same way as any other view function.
