        * Assigning an incompatible pointer type to a pointer raises a TypeError with a descriptive message.

        Tests the behavior of the destructor in CPointerBase when an ImportError is raised.

        This test case verifies that the destructor correctly handles an ImportError, 
        ensuring that it catches and handles the exception as expected. The test creates 
        a fake geometry class with a mock destructor that raises an ImportError, and

        manage resources even when imports fail.
