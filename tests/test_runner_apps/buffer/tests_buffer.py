        Tests that the test framework is correctly configured to write to standard error and standard output streams.

        This test case verifies that the framework can successfully write messages to both stderr and stdout, confirming that the output streams are properly set up. It also includes a trivial assertion to ensure the test passes when run. 

        Returns:
            None
